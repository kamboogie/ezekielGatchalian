						My name is Ezekiel Gatchalian. I am a web application developer specializing in HTML5 and CSS3. CakePHP, LiftScala, Drupal, and Ruby on Rails are some of the web application frameworks I have used.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the database side, I have done SQL scripts and have executed as well as maintained different database objects.  Furthermore, MySQL, and MS SQL Server are two RDMS I have used.
					</p>
					<p>
						My technical portfolio also includes experience with Javascript, AJAX, JQUERY, and Microsoft SQL server platform and tools. Plus, I also have a very good understanding of VB, C#, C++, .Net, and Java.
					</p>

						When I am not programming, you will see me bartending, playing sports, hanging out with friends, and travelling.
